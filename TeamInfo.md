## Project Summary

This project aims to leverage advanced data analytics and Artificial Intelligence (AI) to predict various events and outcomes within the National Basketball Association (NBA). We will focus on developing predictive models for diverse scenarios, including game outcomes, individual player matchups, shot success, and the progression and results of playoff series and championships. The insights generated from this project are expected to be highly valuable for applications in sports betting, strategic coaching decisions, and in-depth media analytics. We have secured access to comprehensive historical NBA datasets to build robust and realistic models.
